This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing.

## Implementation

The implementation was based on a research paper [Sentiment Analysis on Movie Review Data Using Machine Learning Approach](https://github.com/Chirag-Shilwant/Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Dataset/blob/main/Research-Paper.pdf).

## Classifiers Implemented
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes(MNB)
2. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
3. Maximum Entropy(ME)
4. Decision Tree(DT)
5. Gaussian Naive Bayes(GNB)
6. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
